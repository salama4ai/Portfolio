## [Deep Learning Project (protienea firm)](https://github.com/salama4ai/Proteinea).
- in this project, i were asked to generate a **date** given a set of conditions, using any neural network architecture i would like. my input (x) is the conditions on the date, and the output (y) is ANY date that complies with those conditions. This means that, like any generative model, there are many right answers per input x.
[here](https://github.com/salama4ai/Proteinea/blob/main/problem%20statement/Deep%20Learning%20Challenge.pdf) is the complete problem statement 
-**Tools:** Sklearn , Matplotlib , Numpy , Pandas, pytorch, imblearn, calendar
-**steps:** 
+ started by [Exploratory data analysis, then preprocessing](https://github.com/salama4ai/Proteinea/blob/main/model/preprocessing.ipynb)
+ then divide the problem into 2 subproblems:- 
	+ [1- predicting the year submodel](https://github.com/salama4ai/Proteinea/blob/main/model/training_years.ipynb)
	+ [2- predicting the day submodel](https://github.com/salama4ai/Proteinea/blob/main/model/training_days.ipynb)
    
	i started by additional preprocessing step according to the submodel needs, then separete training and test sets  fix the imbalanced data by oversampling(only on training set), then prepare data for neural network, and made traing steps finally save the results to csv file, and the trained model

2- [Topic Extraction (NLP)](https://www.github.com/salama4ai/salama4ai-MinaPharm)
**Objective:**

i were provided with a medical related dataset, containing 5k articles. i was required to demonstrate my NLP, data-mining & topic extraction skills to extract the topics that are included within the dataset along with mapping each article to the corresponding topic names. Each document should be matched to the top three most relevant topic names including the matching probability score.
-**Tools:** Numpy , Pandas, pytorch, gensim, spacy, scispacy, NLTK, REGEX, Sklearn , Matplotlib
-**steps:** 
###steps:-
i started by exploratory data analysis(EDA) and preprocessing
    - Convert the text into lowercase
    - Split text into words (Tokenize)
    - Remove the stop loss words
    - Remove the Punctuation, any symbols, and special characters
    - Normalize the word (Iâ€™ll be using Lemmatization for normalization)
then made **LDA** implementation with both **gensim** and **sklearn**

- i studied many of these courses in 2018-2019, then i concentrate my effort towards packages needed for data science, preprocessing like numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, pytorch, bueatifulsoup, matplotlib, seaborn, ...

- i get impression from companies that they doesn't concern alot or consider courses projects rather they ask about private projects, that made me not pursuing completing the courses projects, 
- i repeat some courses as sometimes i forget some details quikly, and didn't complete some other courses as i found myself don't understand very well, or i'm not satisfied with the content/instructor/explanation
