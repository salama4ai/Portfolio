- i studied many of these courses in 2018-2019, then i concentrate my effort towards packages needed for data science, preprocessing like numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, pytorch, bueatifulsoup, matplotlib, seaborn, ...

- i get impression from companies that they doesn't concern alot or consider courses projects rather they ask about private projects, that made me not pursuing completing the courses projects, 
- i repeat some courses as sometimes i forget some details quikly, and didn't complete some other courses as i found myself don't understand very well, or i'm not satisfied with the content/instructor/explanation
